# Marston-VS-West
A simple street fighter/ smash bros esque video game project about the ongoing debate for best library

This project is made using javascript and the Phaser framework

Current issues are creating temporary hitboxes and implementing a statemachine and creation of a fighter class.

Future goals for the project is implementing a basic ai fighter as well as couch multiplayer and items and other stages.
